# Piggy
---

As Part of the interview process for Triplebyte, I was tasked with coding a reverse proxy from scratch that, when given a URI as part 
of an incoming HTTP request, would return that URI with all English translated to Pig Latin. 

This is what I was able to come up with in 42 minutes. It's ugly but functional.
